#  Sales & Customer Analytics Dashboards
## Project Background


This project presents an interactive sales dashboard built in Tableau using a dataset composed of four core tables: Orders, Customers, Products, and Location. The primary goal of this analysis was to uncover insights into sales performance across different customer segmen, product subcategories, and geographic regions.

By integrating these datasets through common keys‚Äîsuch as Customer ID, Product ID, and Postal Code‚Äîthe dashboard enables dynamic filtering and exploration of key metrics including Sales, Profit, and Quantity. Filters were provided for Customer Name, Subcategory, and detailed geographic levels including City, State, Region, and Country to support localized business decisions.

Key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends were visualized to assist stakeholders in identifying high-performing areas and products, understanding customer distribution, and recognizing opportunities for improved profitability and sales strategy refinement.




##  Project Description Summary

In this project, I developed two dashboards ‚Äî **Sales** and **Customer** ‚Äî based on a simulated retail dataset. The project mirrors real business scenarios with stakeholder-driven requirements to support data-informed decision-making.



##  Project Overview

-  Tools used: Tableau
-  Dashboards: Sales Overview, Customer Analysis
-  Audience: Sales managers, Marketing, Executives
-  Business goal: Enable year-over-year performance tracking, customer behavior analysis, and customer value segmentation


##  Executive Summary

The sales Dashboard reveals strong YoY growth in total sales (+20.4%), profit (+12.5%), and order quantity (+26.8%), driven by top-selling categories like Phones and Chairs. Notably, Copiers led in profitability, while Appliances showed the highest YoY sales growth ‚Äî making it a key area for expansion. However, categories like Machines and Envelopes experienced significant sales declines, and Tables continue to operate at a loss. These trends offer actionable insights for optimizing product strategy and marketing focus.

On the Customer Dashboard, year-over-year growth in customers (+8.6%), sales per customer (+10.8%), and total orders (+28.3%) reflects a healthier and more engaged customer base. November emerged as the peak month for engagement, while January drove the highest revenue per customer. However, a significant portion of customers only place 1‚Äì3 orders, signaling retention gaps. The business should leverage seasonal trends, focus on increasing order frequency, and prioritize top-profit customers like Raymond and Tom to drive long-term value.

## Data Description

- **Overview**
This dataset contains four relational tables: `Orders`, `Customers`, `Products`, and `Location`. These tables support a Tableau sales dashboard focused on tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) such as profit, sales, and quantity sold, with the ability to filter by customer and geographic location.
