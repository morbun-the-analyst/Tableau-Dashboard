#  Sales & Customer Analytics Dashboards

A business-driven Tableau project simulating a retail sales environment. Built to help sales managers, marketing teams, and executives gain insights into performance metrics, customer trends, and segmentation — using clean, interactive dashboards.


##  Project Description Summary

In this project, I developed two dashboards — **Sales** and **Customer** — based on a simulated retail dataset. The project mirrors real business scenarios with stakeholder-driven requirements to support data-informed decision-making.



##  Project Overview

-  Tools used: Tableau
-  Dashboards: Sales Overview, Customer Analysis
-  Audience: Sales managers, Marketing, Executives
-  Business goal: Enable year-over-year performance tracking, customer behavior analysis, and customer value segmentation


##  Executive Summary

The sales Dashboard reveals strong YoY growth in total sales (+20.4%), profit (+12.5%), and order quantity (+26.8%), driven by top-selling categories like Phones and Chairs. Notably, Copiers led in profitability, while Appliances showed the highest YoY sales growth — making it a key area for expansion. However, categories like Machines and Envelopes experienced significant sales declines, and Tables continue to operate at a loss. These trends offer actionable insights for optimizing product strategy and marketing focus.

On the Customer Dashboard, year-over-year growth in customers (+8.6%), sales per customer (+10.8%), and total orders (+28.3%) reflects a healthier and more engaged customer base. November emerged as the peak month for engagement, while January drove the highest revenue per customer. However, a significant portion of customers only place 1–3 orders, signaling retention gaps. The business should leverage seasonal trends, focus on increasing order frequency, and prioritize top-profit customers like Raymond and Tom to drive long-term value.

## Recommendations
-**Focus on Retention and Frequency**
- Most customers place only 1–3 orders → introduce loyalty programs or incentives for repeat purchases
-	Capitalize on January & November Peaks
- January: high AOV per customer — ideal time for product launches or upsells
-	November: top engagement — double down on promotions, flash sales, and remarketing
- **Target Low-Activity Months**
-	Develop campaigns or re-engagement offers for April and February, where both engagement and revenue dip
-**Nurture Top Customers**
-	Profile and replicate behaviors of top customers like Raymond and Tom
-	Consider personal outreach or VIP experiences to retain and expand their lifetime
